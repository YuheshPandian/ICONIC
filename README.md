## 🧪 Quick Implementation

Here's a sample of some icons:

```markdown
## HTML

<!-- Use div tag for good format and it will show them in one line, without div tag it will be displayed on multiple lines -->
<div>
<img src="https://iconic-api.onrender.com/dark/python" width="64px" />
<img src="https://iconic-api.onrender.com/dark/html" width="64px" />
<img src="https://iconic-api.onrender.com/dark/js" width="64px" />
<div>
```
> [!NOTE]  
> It's recommended to use the HTML snippet in GitHub READMEs, as it allows better control over size, styling, and layout.
